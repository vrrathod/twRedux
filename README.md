Total about 18 hours of work.

1. Hamburger menu<br/> 
      Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.<br/> 
      The menu should include links to your [profile], the [home timeline], and the [mentions] view.<br/> 
      <br/> 
2. Profile page<br/> 
      Contains the user header view<br/> 
      Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers<br/> 
      
<br/> 
3. Home Timeline<br/> 
      Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page<br/> 
    Need to improve here a lot
